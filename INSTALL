=== Requirements ===

1. Sphinx Search (http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html)

2. PHP5 with SQLite extension (it is enabled by default as of PHP 5)


=== Installation ===

1. Unpack plugin files into lib/plugins directory of your DokuWiki installation.

2. Run Sphinx Search indexer to index your DokuWiki data for the first time:
        $cd {Your_DokuWiki_Path}/lib/plugins/sphinxsearch/
	$indexer -c sphinx.conf dk_main

3. After indexer completes it's job, run searchd, e.g.:
        $cd {Your_DokuWiki_Path}/lib/plugins/sphinxsearch/
	$searchd -c sphinx.conf
By default plugin is using 9312 as the searchd port, so make sure this
port is free (if you have sphinx on other port, see #5).

4. To have your search results up-to-date, setup cronjob to
periodically re-index your DokuWiki data, e.g.:
    1 10 * * * root {Your_DokuWiki_Path}/lib/plugin/sphinxsearch/indexer.php

5. You can fine-tune the search behavior by editing the configuration
files conf/default.php and sphinx.conf.
