=== Requirements ===

1. Sphinx Search (http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html)

2. PHP5 with SQLite extension (it is enabled by default as of PHP 5)


=== Installation ===

1. Unpack plugin files into lib/plugins directory of your DokuWiki installation.

2. Run Sphinx Search indexer to index your DokuWiki data for the first time. 
Note: you have to run it from lib/plugins/sphinxsearch directory. e.g.:
	$cd {Your_DokuWiki_Path}/lib/plugins/sphinxsearch
	$indexer -c sphinx.conf dk_main

3. After indexer completes it's job, run searched, e.g.:
	$searchd -c sphinx.conf
By default searchd port is 3313, so make sure this port is free (if you have sphinx on other port, see #5).

4. To have your search results up-to-date, setup cronjob to periodically re-index your DokuWiki data, e.g.:
    1 10 * * * root {Your_DokuWiki_Path}/lib/plugin/sphinxsearch/indexer.php

5. You can fine-tune the search behavior by editing the configuration file conf/default.php


=== Troubleshooting ===

PHP allocate memory problem.
This is solved by increasing PHP memory limit - you can use one of the following ways:
	a) using php.ini
		memory_limit = 1024M
	b) inside php script
		ini_set('memory_limit', '1024M');
	c) using .htaccess file
		php_value memory_limit "1024M"
